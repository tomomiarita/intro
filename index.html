	<title>Welcome to Tomomi's Site</title>
<body>
	<h1>Hello team</h1>
	<p>I am Tomomi. I look forward to working with you all coming 4 weeks.</p>
	<img src="tomomi.jpg" />
	<p>I was born in Japan, moved to Oregon for college education, got a job, then got married with a Portlander. </p>
	<p>I love eating so I learned to cook at an early age. I can cook many Japanese dishes without recipes, but it comes down to cooking a chunk of meat I have to ask my husband. I have not cooked a Thanksgiving turkey at this point.</p>
	<p>The quality of food in Portland is so much higher now. Twenty years ago, I was afraid to eat Sushi at a restaurant. Now, there are so many good Sushi restaurants. That makes me very happy!</p>
	<p>That enough for my food talk...</p>
